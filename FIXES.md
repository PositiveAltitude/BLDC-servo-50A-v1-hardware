- I don't think for +3.3VA you have FB placed to a wrong spot. I usually don't use L there and just place FB instead. So maybe just delete L and move FB on it's place?
- I don't think we need reset switch. It actually could be an issue in high-vibration environment. But keep 100n cap on NRST. 
- SWD connector needs NRST pin. Sometimes it's hard to configure programmer without hardware reset.
- Only one CAN termination resistor needed on this board.
- I think CAN_H and CAN_L TVS diodes upside-down no?
- Encoder and it's connector(wrong connector btw) not needed on this board. We will need a small separate board. I think we should move it to a separate sheet or even a separate file.
- VCC is tied to 5V this is wrong. You use VCC in places where it should be 3.3V (for example pull-ups for open drain signals from driver). I suggest to stop using VCC at all and just use 3.3V instead.
- 1000p over shunt resistor is questionable do we really need them? 
- ASENSE protection is not correct. It should be also protected from going below 0. It's more convenient to use 3-pin dual schottky assemblies in sot-23 package.  
- No RC-snubbers on motor phases
